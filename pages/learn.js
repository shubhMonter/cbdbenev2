						Cannabinoids are chemical compounds. They are produced naturally in

					</p>
					<p>
						The human body produces Endocannabinoids (endo means ‘within’, as in
						within the body), just like cannabis and some other plants produce
						phytocannabinoids (<em>Phyto</em> – meaning ‘plant’). Our body also

						For starters, it has way too many syllables. But it’s similar to how

						morphine-like chemicals, which we know as endorphins (‘endo’
						meaning). And our bodies have endogenous cannabinoids and

To be considered legal in the US, CBD products must be derived from industrial hemp which contains less than .3% THC, or “trace amounts.” These trace amounts generally aren't enough THC to show up on a basic drug test, but it is not impossible. To have a significant amount of THC in your system, you would have to consume an EXTREMELY large dose- potentially over 30–40 times the suggested daily dosage. Usually CBD never shows up on a drug test however, Drug tests vary as to what compounds are being analyzed, so we are unable to make any claims or guarantees regarding use of our products and drug tests.

						vessels under the tongue. The capillaries under the tongue help
						carry the CBD oil into our bloodstream within 10-15 minutes. CBD in
						edibles and capsules can take about 45 minutes. Because of the high

//             helps retain more terpenes and cannabinoids in the oil. The result

//             Dosing is highly personalized and depends on age, weight, and many

//             The key to taking CBD oil drops is to start out one drop at a time.
//             And just as importantly, CBD Oil must be taken under the tongue and
//             held there for 30 to 60 seconds. Why? Sublingual dosing is the
//             fastest way for the active ingredients to absorb into the tiny blood
//             vessels under the tongue. The capillaries under the tongue help
//             carry the CBD oil into our bloodstream within 10-15 minutes. CBD in
//             edibles and capsules can take about 45 minutes. Because of the high
//             rate of absorption, this means that sublingual dosing is also the
//             most cost-effective way to take CBD.
